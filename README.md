Proposed system is an easy-to-implement user friendly utility that is much required in modern context. The necessity of scheming such a web amenity is to act as a central base for all health-related difficulties so that anybody with a net facility can have access to it notwithstanding their time and place. This structure aims to bridge the gap between efficient healthcare and rural areas by bringing them together on an interactive platform.

MyDOC presents a data-intensive application effort  in an attempt to extend accessibility to medical consultancy in remote and rural areas. We  propose to implement ML based approach on medical information systems. The integration  of disease symptoms data and corresponding, a priori, medical-recommendation data along  with ML provides the tools for predicting future diseases and make medical prescriptions to  the concerned. The DBMS is designed to be able to search the database and make disease risk assessments  based upon the stated conditions. This additionally provides a virtual consultancy service with several add-on features.

**Installation :**

Clone or download the repo.

Open command prompt in the downloaded folder

Install all the dependencies:

- _pip install -r requirements.txt_
- _Run the application_
- _python app.py_

Following datasets were used from Kaggle for training and testing of disease prediction models :

1. [Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
2. [Breast Cancer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
3. [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)
4. [Kidney Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mansoordaku/ckdisease)
5. [Liver Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/indian-liver-patient-records)
6. [Malaria Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria)
7. [Pneumonia Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

Models were created and tested to have sufficient accuracy.

| **Disease** | **Type of Model** | **Accuracy** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Diabetes | Machine Learning Model | 98.25% |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Breast Cancer | Machine Learning Model | 98.25% |
| Heart Disease | Machine Learning Model | 85.25% |
| Kidney Disease | Machine Learning Model | 99% |
| Liver Disease | Machine Learning Model | 78% |
| Malaria | Deep Learning Model(CNN) | 96% |
| Pneumonia | Deep Learning Model(CNN) | 95% |
